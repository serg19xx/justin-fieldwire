## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Database Schema Requirements:**

```sql
-- Resource Categories
CREATE TABLE resource_categories (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    type ENUM('equipment', 'material', 'tools')
);

-- Resource Inventory
CREATE TABLE resources (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(200),
    category_id INT,
    status ENUM('available', 'allocated', 'maintenance', 'retired'),
    cost_per_unit DECIMAL(10,2),
    location VARCHAR(200),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Resource Allocations
CREATE TABLE resource_allocations (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    resource_id INT,
    task_id INT,
    project_id INT,
    allocated_by INT,
    allocated_at TIMESTAMP,
    released_at TIMESTAMP,
    quantity INT,
    cost DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Budget Tracking
CREATE TABLE project_budgets (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INT,
    resource_category_id INT,
    allocated_budget DECIMAL(12,2),
    spent_amount DECIMAL(12,2),
    remaining_budget DECIMAL(12,2)
);
```

### **API Endpoints Required:**

```
GET    /api/v1/resources              # List resources
POST   /api/v1/resources              # Create resource
PUT    /api/v1/resources/{id}         # Update resource
DELETE /api/v1/resources/{id}         # Delete resource

GET    /api/v1/resources/available    # Get available resources
POST   /api/v1/resources/allocate      # Allocate resource
POST   /api/v1/resources/release       # Release resource

GET    /api/v1/budgets/{project_id}   # Get project budget
PUT    /api/v1/budgets/{project_id}  # Update project budget
```

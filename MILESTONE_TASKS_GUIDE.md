# Milestone Tasks Guide

## Overview

Milestone tasks are special point-in-time events that mark key project phases, inspections, meetings, deliveries, and other critical project moments. Unlike regular tasks that have duration, milestone tasks represent specific moments in time and are visually distinct in the calendar.

## Milestone Types

### 🔍 Inspection
- **Purpose**: Quality control, safety checks, compliance verification
- **Examples**: 
  - Safety inspection of construction site
  - Quality control check of materials
  - Code compliance inspection
  - Equipment inspection

### 🏗️ Site Visit
- **Purpose**: On-site assessments, progress reviews, stakeholder visits
- **Examples**:
  - Client site visit
  - Architect progress review
  - Manager walkthrough
  - Vendor site assessment

### 👥 Meeting
- **Purpose**: Project coordination, decision-making, status updates
- **Examples**:
  - Weekly project meeting
  - Design review meeting
  - Client presentation
  - Team coordination meeting

### 📋 Review
- **Purpose**: Document reviews, plan approvals, process evaluations
- **Examples**:
  - Design document review
  - Budget review
  - Schedule review
  - Risk assessment review

### 📦 Delivery
- **Purpose**: Material deliveries, equipment handover, milestone completion
- **Examples**:
  - Material delivery confirmation
  - Equipment installation completion
  - Phase completion delivery
  - Final project handover

### ✅ Approval
- **Purpose**: Official approvals, sign-offs, authorization milestones
- **Examples**:
  - Design approval
  - Budget approval
  - Change order approval
  - Final project approval

### 🎯 Other
- **Purpose**: Custom milestone types not covered by standard categories
- **Examples**:
  - Custom project events
  - Special ceremonies
  - Unique project requirements

## Visual Indicators

### Calendar Display
- **Status-Based Colors**: Milestone tasks use the same color scheme as regular tasks based on status
- **Type-Specific Icons**: Each milestone type has a unique emoji icon
- **Single-Day Events**: Milestones appear as single-day events in the calendar
- **Status Colors** (same as regular tasks):
  - **Planned**: Blue (#3B82F6)
  - **Done**: Gray (#6B7280)
  - **Blocked**: Red (#EF4444)
  - **Delayed**: Orange (#F59E0B)

### Task List Display
- **Icon Indicators**: 
  - 🎯 for milestone tasks
  - 📋 for regular tasks
- **Status Colors**: Same color scheme as calendar for consistency

### Task Titles
Milestone tasks display with their type icon in the title:
```
Safety Inspection 🔍 (100%)
Client Meeting 👥 (0%)
Material Delivery 📦 (100%)
```

## Milestone Status Management

### Available Statuses
Milestone tasks have a simplified status system compared to regular tasks:

- **Planned** (Blue): Milestone is scheduled and ready to be executed
- **Done** (Gray): Milestone has been completed successfully
- **Blocked** (Red): Milestone was skipped, cancelled, or could not be completed

### Status Workflow
1. **Creation**: All milestones start as "Planned"
2. **Execution**: On the scheduled date, responsible person marks as "Done" or "Blocked"
3. **No In-Progress**: Milestones don't have "In Progress" status since they are point-in-time events

## Creating Milestone Tasks
1. **Click "Add Milestone"**: Use the "🎯 Add Milestone" button in the calendar header
2. **Select Type**: Choose the appropriate milestone type from the dropdown
3. **Set Date**: Milestone tasks use a single date (start and end are the same)
4. **Add Details**: Include relevant notes and description

### Best Practices
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the milestone purpose
- **Proper Assignment**: Assign to the responsible person or team
- **Detailed Notes**: Include important details, requirements, or outcomes
- **Dependencies**: Link milestones to related tasks when appropriate

## Use Cases

### Construction Projects
- **Foundation Inspection** 🔍: Quality check after foundation completion
- **Client Walkthrough** 🏗️: Progress review with client
- **Material Delivery** 📦: Confirmation of material arrival
- **Permit Approval** ✅: Official permit sign-off

### Software Projects
- **Code Review** 📋: Technical review of code changes
- **Client Demo** 👥: Product demonstration to client
- **Release Delivery** 📦: Software release milestone
- **Architecture Approval** ✅: Technical architecture sign-off

### Event Planning
- **Venue Inspection** 🔍: Site visit and assessment
- **Vendor Meeting** 👥: Coordination with suppliers
- **Equipment Delivery** 📦: Setup completion
- **Final Approval** ✅: Event go/no-go decision

## Dependencies and Milestones

### Milestone Dependencies
- **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: Task must complete before milestone
- **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Task and milestone start together
- **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Task and milestone complete together
- **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: Milestone starts when task finishes

### Common Patterns
- **Inspection Dependencies**: Inspections often depend on task completion
- **Approval Dependencies**: Approvals may depend on review completion
- **Delivery Dependencies**: Deliveries may depend on preparation tasks

## Calendar Integration

### Visibility
- **All Users**: Milestone tasks are visible to all project members
- **Role-Based**: Milestone indicators follow the same role-based visibility as dependency indicators
- **Legend**: Milestone types are shown in the calendar legend for users with appropriate permissions

### Interaction
- **Drag and Drop**: Milestones can be moved like regular tasks
- **No Resizing**: Milestones cannot be resized (they are point-in-time events)
- **Status Updates**: Milestone status can be updated through the milestone dialog
- **Dependencies**: Milestones respect dependency constraints when moved
- **Project Bounds**: Milestones are validated against project boundaries

## Best Practices

### Planning
1. **Identify Key Milestones**: Determine critical project checkpoints
2. **Set Realistic Dates**: Ensure milestone dates are achievable
3. **Assign Responsibility**: Clearly assign milestone ownership
4. **Link Dependencies**: Connect milestones to related tasks

### Execution
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep milestone status current
2. **Documentation**: Record milestone outcomes and decisions
3. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of milestone completion
4. **Follow-up**: Take action based on milestone results

### Monitoring
1. **Track Progress**: Monitor milestone completion rates
2. **Identify Delays**: Flag delayed milestones early
3. **Adjust Plans**: Modify schedules based on milestone outcomes
4. **Report Status**: Include milestone status in project reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Missing Icons**: Ensure milestone type is properly selected
- **Color Issues**: Check that milestone checkbox is enabled
- **Date Problems**: Verify start and end dates are set correctly
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Review dependency constraints

### Solutions
- **Refresh Calendar**: Reload the calendar view
- **Check Permissions**: Verify user has appropriate access
- **Update Task**: Modify milestone through task dialog
- **Review Dependencies**: Adjust dependency relationships

## Technical Notes

### Data Structure
- **milestone**: Boolean flag indicating milestone status
- **milestone_type**: Enum value specifying milestone category
- **start_planned**: Milestone date (same as end_planned for point events)
- **end_planned**: Always same as start_planned for milestones
- **status**: Simplified status system (planned, done, blocked)

### API Integration
- **Create**: Include milestone and milestone_type in task creation
- **Update**: Modify milestone properties through task update
- **Query**: Filter tasks by milestone status and type
- **Export**: Include milestone information in project exports
